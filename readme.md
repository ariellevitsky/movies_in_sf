# Running
To launch the app, simply download the code and open index.html in your preferred browser.

# Notes
I tried to ensure that the assignment was as portable as possible. I would like most folks to be able to simply open index.html in a current browser and run the app. Consequently I chose to use CDNs as opposed to setting up a VueJS dev environment. Unfortunately that means that the way I have organized my code does not reflect my true preferences.

With a proper VueJS dev environment, I would have a separate folder for components and each component's template, javascript and css would be contained in a single file.

A couple of things to consider:

* My CSS is not as clean as I would like it. I modified the original template to account for the new expectations (truncation etc.) and it did introduce some complexity.
* I did notice that the checkboxes showed an "x" on checked, but wasn't sure if you wanted me to reproduce it.

Let me know if you have any additional questions!
